# Tank
This is a classic tank game.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and raylib-py.

After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
